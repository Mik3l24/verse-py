## Compiler for the Verbose programming language

The Verbose programming language is a simple, 
statically-typed procedural language that is designed to be easy to read,
while giving access to C-like low-level features. 
It is intended to be a good language for beginners to learn programming concepts in the fields like embedded programming, 
but it is also powerful enough to be used for more complex projects.

Both the compiler and the language syntax and features are still WIP and subject to change.
